# Fascinating Technology Commentary (April 2018)

* The gap between Android and its nemesis, Apple’s iOS, has always boiled down to trust. Unlike Google, Apple doesn’t make its money by tracking the behavior of its users, and unlike the vast and varied Android ecosystem, there are only ever a couple of iPhone models, each of which is updated with regularity and over a long period of time. Owning an iPhone, you can be confident that you’re among Apple’s priority users (even if Apple faces its own cohort of critics accusing it of planned obsolescence), whereas with an Android device, as evidenced today, you can’t even be sure that the security bulletins and updates you’re getting are truthful.

* That leaves ample room for Apple to do what it usually does, which is to arrive late to an idea but popularize it through smarter and better integration into its overall user experience.

* Customization is messy. Android is messy. So it makes sense that the ultimate fix for Android messaging wasn’t to eliminate messiness, but to embrace it.

* This creative element is where the real power of Labo lies. Once you build the kits and play through the games, there’s not much else to do. A simple arcade fishing game is fun to play every so often, but it’s not the kind of experience you can lose yourself in for long.

* Which, to anyone with longer than shoulder-length hair who has played on a recreational soccer league as a kid, seems nuts. Aren’t these people, like, fighting each other? While doing flips and jumps and stuff? Even Violet Baudelaire, the protagonist of A Series of Unfortunate Events, famously had to tie up her hair with a ribbon in order to focus, which requires basically zero physical exertion.

* Brin starts his letter by quoting the opening lines of Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities — “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” He notes how computing power has exploded since Google was founded in 1998, and how, at that time, the technique which now forms the backbone of contemporary AI, neural networks, was just “a forgotten footnote in computer science.” [Google’s Sergey Brin warns of the threat from AI in today’s ‘technology renaissance’  - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/28/17295064/google-ai-threat-sergey-brin-founders-letter-technology-renaissance)
* Technology companies have historically been wide- eyed and idealistic about the opportunities that their innovations create. And for the overwhelming part, the arc of history shows that these advances, including the Internet and mobile devices, have created opportunities and dramatically improved the quality of life for billions of people. However, there are very legitimate and pertinent issues being raised, across the globe, about the implications and impacts of these advances. This is an important discussion to have. While I am optimistic about the potential to bring technology to bear on the greatest problems in the world, we are on a path that we must tread with deep responsibility, care, and humility. That is Alphabet’s goal. [2017 Founders’ Letter - Investor Relations - Alphabet](https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/2017/index.html)
* Facebook had replaced much of the emotional labor of social networking that consumed previous generations. We have forgotten (or perhaps never noticed) how many hours our parents spent keeping their address books up to date, knocking on doors to make sure everyone in the neighborhood was invited to the weekend BBQ, doing the rounds of phone calls with relatives, clipping out interesting newspaper articles and mailing them to a friend, putting together the cards for Valentine’s Day, Easter, Christmas, and more. We don’t think about what it’s like to carefully file business cards alphabetically in a Rolodex. People spent a lot of time on these sorts of things, once, because the less of that work you did, the less of a social network you had. [I tried leaving Facebook.

* Taking such a broad view of what qualifies as “competition” is really the only way T-Mobile can claim that there are upward of eight major competitors in the space it’s in. These companies may all offer access to the internet, but their services have meaningfully different constraints and are used in meaningfully different ways by their subscribers. [T-Mobile says it has seven major competitors, which is complete nonsense - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17302454/tmobile-sprint-merger-internet-competition)
