# Fascinating Technology Commentary (July 2018)

* When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail; when all you have is increased transistor density and Metcalfe’s Law, everything looks like a software problem; when all you have are VCs and incubators, everything just needs a little startup disruption. [Tech in a time of travesties – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/tech-in-a-time-of-travesties/)
* In the most groan-inducing way possible, “there’s an app for that” is back, and more important than ever. Not only are apps the centerpiece of the Siri experience, but it’s their capabilities that extend Siri’s — the better the apps you have, the better Siri can be. [Apple’s Shortcuts will flip the switch on Siri’s potential – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/08/shortcuts-will-flip-the-switch-for-apple-on-siris-potential-just-not-how-you-think/)
* While it makes sense to better utilize this space, I’m not sold on having ads for adult-oriented shows appearing on the same login screen that’s used by a child. The ads themselves (so far) have not been inappropriate, but it doesn’t seem like a good fit for multi-person households and families. For example, I now have to explain to a school-ager why they can’t watch that funny-looking cartoon, “BoJack Horseman.” [Netflix experiments with promoting its shows on the login screen – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/16/netflix-experiments-with-promoting-its-shows-on-the-login-screen/)
* Elon Musk seems not only intent on burning all the goodwill he earned for trying to help last week’s Thai cave rescue, but rolling around in its ashes, too. [Elon Musk tweets he’ll ‘bet ya a signed dollar that Thai cave rescuer is a ‘pedo’ – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/15/elon-musk-tweets-hell-bet-ya-a-signed-dollar-that-thai-cave-rescuer-is-a-pedo/)
* For the last few years now, BMW has wrestled with the question of what it’ll mean to be a luxury car manufacturer in the age of electric cars, autonomous driving and rapidly changing — and increasing — customer expectations. What, after all, makes something the “ultimate driving machine” when the driver eventually stops driving? [Why BMW needs to own its customer experience from start to finish – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/15/why-bmw-needs-to-own-its-customer-experience-from-start-to-finish/)
* Technology companies have a privacy problem. They’re terribly good at invading ours and terribly negligent at protecting their own. In this moment when corporate innovation and state power are merging in ways that consumers are only just beginning to fathom, executives who have to answer to a buying public are now pleading for government to set up some rails. Late capitalism is weird. [As facial recognition technology becomes pervasive, Microsoft (yes, Microsoft) issues a call for regulation – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/13/as-facial-recognition-technology-becomes-pervasive-microsoft-yes-microsoft-issues-a-call-for-regulation/)
* Now that Adobe has shifted to a subscription model, the company needs to increase stickiness as much as possible. If you end up spending more time in Adobe apps because your favorite app is on all platforms, you’ll keep paying for Creative Cloud every month. [Adobe could bring Photoshop to the iPad – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/13/adobe-could-bring-photoshop-to-the-ipad/)
* Alex Jones’ Infowars is a fake-news peddler. But Facebook deleting its Page could ignite a fire that consumes the network. Still, some critics are asking why it hasn’t done so already. [Facebook would make a martyr by banning Infowars – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/13/her-emails-two-point-oh/)
* To put it mildly, news media has been on the sidelines in AI development. As a consequence, in the age of AI-powered personalized interfaces, the news organizations don’t anymore get to define what’s real news, or, even more importantly, what’s truthful or trustworthy. Today, social media platforms, search engines and content aggregators control user flows to the media content and affect directly what kind of news content is created. [A new hope: AI for news media – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/12/a-new-hope-ai-for-news-media/)
* A warning ticker pops on TVs, if you’re watching cable… but you’ve got your eyes glued to Netflix, or Hulu, or some other online streaming service. Should these services, with their ever-increasing ownership of our screen time, be prepped to broadcast these warnings? [Senate wants emergency alerts to go out through Netflix, Spotify, etc. | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/senate-wants-emergency-alerts-to-go-out-through-netflix-spotify-etc/)
* Facebook has hit a wall. The social network succumbed to its uncoolnees and public backlash over its handling of fake news, privacy, and digital wellbeing to miss some of Wall Street’s estimates. [Facebook stock tanks from mixed Q2 with slowest-ever growth – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/facebook-q2-2018-earnings/) 
* These fines then are less about punishing behavior — after all, they aren’t deterring would-be monopolists from their activities. Instead, they essentially act as an excess profits tax, a way to uniquely target extraordinarily profitable tech companies without changing general business taxes. [Alphabet earnings and the jaws of antitrust – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/alphabet-earnings-and-the-jaws-of-antitrust/)
* However, what Google has that its rivals don’t is control of the whole AI stack. A customer can store their data on Google’s Cloud; train their algorithms using TPUs; and then carry out on-device inference using the new Edge TPUs. And, more than likely, they’ll be creating their machine learning software using TensorFlow — a coding framework created and operated by Google.
