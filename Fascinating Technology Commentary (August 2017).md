# Fascinating Technology Commentary (August 2017)

* All the signs were there that Elon Musk would reverse his promise to stay clear of commercializing the idea he first proposed back in 2013. However, the website for an upcoming student contest used to display the line: “We are not developing a commercial Hyperloop ourselves.” That sentence was recently removed, Bloomberg reports. [Elon Musk reportedly wants to build his own hyperloop — tunnels and all - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/16095418/elon-musk-hyperloop-tunnel-boring-company)
* Imitation is a form of flattery. Great artists steal. You can choose whatever cliché you prefer, but the truth of the matter is that many of the products we use today are copies of, or at least inspired by, something that came before it. In the laptop world, Apple’s MacBook Air was the inspiration for countless Windows laptops for more than half a decade. In more recent times, Microsoft’s Surface Pro lineup has been the muse by which many PC makers have designed their two-in-one devices.

* Cords are today’s equivalent of yesterday’s ballpoint pens. We lose them, break them, and eventually, we leave them behind. Cords are an instrument of communication, like pen to paper.

* It’s tempting to believe that when we’re successful, our successes are solely because of our own merits and that everyone ends up succeeding to the extent they deserve. But meritocracy is an ideal, not a reality. “It’s something we wish was real, in our better moments we aspire to it,” Hicks says. “But it’s dangerous to think about it as a thing that operates.” It’s a simplistic view of the world that’s only comforting to the people on top.[Science doesn’t explain tech’s diversity problem — history does - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16153740/tech-diversity-problem-science-history-explainer-inequality)
* Make no mistake about it, the Galaxy Note 8 will be one of the most closely scrutinized phones of this year. Like the Galaxy S8 before it, this smartphone will not be getting the benefit of the doubt with any reports of malfunction or failure. Should any pervasive issues of reliability arise around the Note 8, that would create the biggest brand blemish that the smartphone industry has yet known. [Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 faces one low, but unconditional expectation - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/23/16185492/samsung-note-8-2017-keynote-date-rumors-what-to-expect)
* But you don’t just learn for the sake of learning. Learning is for doing, at least theoretically. And I’m worried that Apple’s penchant for safety rails, epitomized but not limited to the gap between Swift Playgrounds “learning” and Xcode “doing” seems stifling. [The Xcode cliff: is Apple teaching kids to code, or just about code? - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17173362/apple-swift-playgrounds-xcode-cliff-ipad-learn-to-code-education)
* “It is very common,” Rosenstein told the newspaper in October, “for humans to develop things with the best of intentions and for them to have unintended, negative consequences.” [The person behind the Like button says software is wasting our time - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172404/justin-rosenstein-asana-social-media-facebook-timeline-gantt)
* OnePlus agrees with the widely held view that Apple “accelerates the adoption of things within the industry,” adding the subtle caveat of “where it makes sense.” (Related side note: the OnePlus 6 will have a headphone jack). [The OnePlus 6 will have a notch, and here’s why - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17152840/oneplus-6-notch-size-android-flagship)
* It makes sense why Google would make this change: according to its own data, one out of three Android Wear watches is paired to an iPhone, so taking Android out of the name could help broaden the audience. There’s also the ongoing trend of Google minimizing the use of the word “Android” in its product portfolio (see: Android Pay is now Google Pay).

* By definition, bankruptcy occurs when an entity cannot pay its debts. But as of this writing, Mt. Gox has enough assets to pay off its claims with more than $1.4 billion worth of bitcoins left over. The trouble is figuring out what to do with them.
