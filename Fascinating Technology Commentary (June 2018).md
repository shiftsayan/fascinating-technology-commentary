# Fascinating Technology Commentary (June 2018)

* At the end of the day, Apple and Google are taking some real, introspective strides here when it comes to giving users information about how they use their phones. And yes, there are certainly cynics who may feel that Apple and Google’s efforts are disingenuous — after all, these companies have always wanted to ensure that users, hardware sales, and, most importantly, profits go up ahead of anything else. [How do Apple’s Screen Time and Google Digital Wellbeing stack up? - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17426922/apple-digital-health-vs-google-wellbeing-time-well-spent-wwdc-2018)
* As for faith in the quality of Apple software, it’s never been more important as the company shifts away from a business primarily propped up by iPhone sales to one revolving more around a software and services ecosystem. [WWDC 2018: the stakes have never been higher for Apple software - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17419154/apple-wwdc-2018-ios-12-mac-macos-rebuild-trust)
* Microsoft has struggled with developer love for years, and it’s a big part of the reasons Windows Phone failed and that its Universal Windows Apps platform hasn’t taken off. Microsoft has spent recent years improving Windows 10 so it’s a respectable development box. [Microsoft confirms it will acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal)
* Computex has always been the Wintel show. Before the age of Android-running, Qualcomm-powered smartphones, the dominant software-hardware combo in the world of personal computing was that of Microsoft’s Windows OS and Intel’s CPUs. But now Microsoft is preparing for a post-Windows future and Intel is scrambling to figure out what else it can do beside baking chips for a satiated audience of PC users.

* However, what the Cambridge Analytica scandal really revealed was how today’s digital ecosystem is built on the relatively free exchange of personal information, and how easy it is for tech companies to fudge the concept of user “consent” by getting people to agree to share data without actually understanding what it is they’re agreeing to.

* But being on the frontline of a new technology means that you have to deal with problems that no one else has encountered, and find answers to questions that people are asking for the first time. [Tesla can change so much with over-the-air updates that it’s messing with some owners’ heads - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/2/17413732/tesla-over-the-air-software-updates-brakes)
* But to understand the potential of this sort of tech, don’t think of it as AI; think of it as an obedient monkey that’s house-trained and you’ve taught to recognize a visual cue of your choice. Our monkey friend can’t do much but go “eee eee eee” whenever it spots whatever it is you asked it to look out for, but that’s still a handy monkey to have around. [It’s easier than you think to craft AI tools without typing a line of code - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17452742/deep-learning-ai-learn-lobe-made-easy-coding)
* If you speak to the Prize bots yourself, even accepting the fact that they’re currently in their underdeveloped, larval stage, you can sense the gulf in understanding as clearly as you can hear that the voice you’re speaking to is artificial. The techniques being developed by the teams at this year’s Alexa Prize are ingenious and worthy of praise, but chatbots still have a long way to go before they match humanity in its gift of the gab. [Inside Amazon’s $3.5 million competition to make Alexa chat like a human - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/13/17453994/amazon-alexa-prize-2018-competition-conversational-ai-chatbots)
* The Pixar “brain trust” — a core group of insiders who push the studio’s chosen writers and directors toward high-quality and immense risks — has a knack for emotional insight and a track record that speaks for the value of pushing the limits of what animation can do, visually and narratively. [Incredibles 2 review: Pixar moves away from complicated emotions - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17468348/incredibles-2-review-pixar-disney-brad-bird)
* The app isn’t completely broken, mind you; you’re still able to chat with folks when it successfully opens after a crash. But this is still a pretty nasty bug. One wonders how this wasn’t picked up by Facebook’s developer team. I know tech companies are trying to be more mindful about the amount of time we’re all spending on our phones, but come on, people. This isn’t the answer. [Facebook’s latest Messenger update for iOS is making the app crash constantly - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17468136/facebook-messenger-ios-update-crash-bug)
* Yet seeing the amount of money and time that went into Epic’s display, including its lavish afterparty that evening on the grounds outside the LA Memorial Coliseum, should have been enough to convince even the most skeptical non-believer that Fortnite is a force to be reckoned with. Epic’s game won’t be on top forever, certainly, but it’s riding a wave that feels far from cresting any time soon. [Fortnite’s celebrity tournament felt like a trial run for Epic’s grand e-sports ambitions   - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/17/17471216/fortnite-pro-am-tournament-epic-games-e-sports-celebrity-e3-2018)
* Microsoft’s acquisition looks like a strategic purchase to win back developer interest, rather than a product that will drive revenue by itself. Alongside LinkedIn, Microsoft now has a big amount of insight into developers and the tech industry job market. It’s a position that might make competitors a little uneasy. Apple, Facebook, Google, and many other big tech companies use GitHub, but will they continue to do so in the future? [Here’s what GitHub developers really think about Microsoft’s acquisition - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17474284/microsoft-github-acquisition-developer-reaction)
* And yet, the tectonic plates are shifting. But they’re shifting under Facebook, as tectonic plates do. The fall of Facebook was never going to be people quitting the service en masse – it’s too interwoven into the fabric of the way many of us use the web these days – it was always going to be the people who never really use the service in the first place. In this regard, the situation is similar to cable. For years and years we’ve heard about “cord cutters” – that is, the people who cancel their cable service (I’m one of them!). But the real story, the one that is and will be far more impactful, is the “cord nevers” – that is, the people who never got cable in the first place. Again, the young people.

* The phone’s camera slider is also a cool retort to anyone clinging to the outdated accusation that Android device makers only ever copy the iPhone. But it’s not going to change the world or even the way phones are designed. It’s just a bad idea that’s executed well. [Mechanical camera sliders are the best bad idea of 2018 - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/19/17478298/oppo-find-x-camera-slider-mobile-technology-2018)
* Known for PCs and servers, Intel’s business has been disrupted by smartphones and the cloud, and the company was caught seemingly unaware by the rise of AI and autonomous vehicles. While you might have previously cared about what Pentium processor was inside a laptop with an Intel sticker plastered on it, these days, Intel’s relevance has declined. You don’t hear “Intel Inside” anymore or the jingle during commercials, and billions of smartphones don’t rely on Intel processors. [Intel now faces a fight for its future - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17492184/intel-future-ceo-brian-krzanich-resignation-2018)
* “If we are training machine learning systems to mimic decisions made in a biased society, using data generated by that society, then those systems will necessarily reproduce its biases,” said Hanna Wallach, a Microsoft senior researcher.
