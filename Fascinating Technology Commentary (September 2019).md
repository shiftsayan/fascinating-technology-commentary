# Fascinating Technology Commentary (September 2019)

* While there will be plenty of competitors, not all of them are playing the same game. Services like Netflix, Hulu, and WarnerMedia want to offer a skinnier version of a traditional cable package. They want subscribers to feel like they can get everything they need in one place. It’s why they sit at the higher end of subscription packages, running between $12 and a rumored $16 a month. But Apple isn’t in that race. TV Plus is most similar to Disney, trying to create a supercharged version of a traditional cable channel. (HBO Go, which is built on top of a literal cable channel, is another obvious example.)

* Ever since Microsoft slunk out of the smartphone market, we’ve been waiting to see what the company’s mobile strategy under CEO Satya Nadella would be. The answer for Microsoft is to win at the app and services layer instead of the operating system layer. It’s possible to make a Microsoft-ified Android phone right now if you like. Install Office and Outlook, Microsoft’s launcher, and connect it up to OneDrive. The company won’t own every corner of your phone, but it will be there in the places where you spend the most time.
