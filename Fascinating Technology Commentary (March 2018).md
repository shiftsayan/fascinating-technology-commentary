# Fascinating Technology Commentary (March 2018)

* While Nintendo’s consoles tend to be less powerful than competitors, the company does have a habit of exploiting inexpensive technology — touchscreens, motion sensors, and so on — and making them core to the system’s appeal. With the Switch, Nintendo has done the exact same thing, but with the console’s fundamental processing hardware. Combined with a smart hybrid design, the result is Nintendo’s first system in decades that can claim legitimate technical superiority.

* There are other benefits to sticking with old-fashioned cartridges. Unlike digital titles, it’s easier to return or resell games that you’re finished with or didn’t like. And the fact that you can just pop out your copy of Zelda and lend it to a friend for a few weeks is something that will likely never be possible with a digital copy. There’s also the issue that physical copies of games — particularly older titles — tend to get cheaper as time goes on, unlike the relatively stagnant digital marketplace.

* The fear, of course, is that Android will lose the information density most users currently enjoy in favor of the big bubbles on iOS. That (thankfully) doesn’t appear to be the case here; instead, it’s just a subtle stylistic change that more clearly delineates the two parts of the drawer from each other and from the rest of the OS.

* It is antithetical to platform-agnostic Sonos and unabashedly so, as if Apple is daring its competitors to try and compete with its hardware prowess and platform lock-in.

* AMP has served as a vessel for worries about Google’s power over the web, the dicey future of news publishing, and whatever general angst we all feel about the sorry state of most mobile webpages. [Inside Google’s plan to make the whole web as fast as AMP - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095078/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-page-announcement-standard-web-packaging-urls)
* Know Your Meme set itself apart by approaching memes with journalistic integrity and rigor long before most people thought they deserved such treatment — or even knew what they were.

* Electric cars can take a long time to charge, which helps explain why Tesla is so invested in building glorified waiting rooms at its Supercharger stations for its customers. The New York Times recently referred to it as “charging time trauma,” identifying it as a hurdle for mass electric vehicle adoption among consumers more accustomed to quick fill-ups at a gas station.

* If the last decade of SXSW celebrated the promise of social media, the next years may well be dominated by the reckoning. Questions about the unintended consequences of social networks pervaded this year’s event. Academics, business leaders, and Facebook executives weighed in on how social platforms spread misinformation, encourage polarization, and promote hate speech. It wasn’t the first time SXSW has examined the darker side of social media — several sessions grappled with targeted harassment in 2016 — but it felt like the most sustained reflection on the subject to date. “I don’t think it’s a losing battle,” said Alex Hardiman, head of news products at Facebook, “but I think it’s a really hard one.”  [The reckoning over social media has transformed SXSW - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17114180/sxsw-social-media-ev-williams-steve-huffman-mark-warner-eddie-cue)
* Computers are great tools, but they’re no substitute for the physicality of a human face and human expression. They’re also no substitute for imagination, inspiration, and a willingness to reassess when your cosmic purple threat looks like the love child of Vin Diesel and a prune. The real struggle in superhero films isn’t for world dominance, but to determine which will dominate the future, CGI or the accessible emotions of a visible human actor. [Infinity War’s Thanos proves CGI supervillains are a terrible idea - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17130846/infinity-wars-trailer-thanos-cgi-supervillains-mcu-characters)
* But this incident highlights a key feature of Facebook, to utilize personal information to deliver specific advertising to individuals, and only goes to underscore a critical weakness in the American electorate: that this information can not only be used to manipulate an election, but it can be obtained relatively easily, with few checks. [Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook data was a ‘grossly unethical experiment’ - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/18/17134270/cambridge-analyticas-facebook-data-underscores-critical-flaw-american-electorate)
* But for now, there are plenty of substantive critiques of big tech companies and how they handle our data. Leaks of data can make us vulnerable — and not just to political campaigns. The thing to fear is not a few shadowy data brokers targeting your “inner demons.” It’s how little Facebook appears to be doing to protect our privacy.

* ”As we move from an app-based environment to a web-based one, we believe the true potential of webOS has yet to be seen,” said Park. [webOS ready to move beyond TVs, says LG - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17138246/free-webos-open-source-download)
* Apple’s AirPods design, which I initially ridiculed, is actually the best and most functional one available for truly wireless buds today. Because Apple moved the Bluetooth electronics and batteries to the stem, it was able to use the full cavity of each bud for sound reproduction. That’s how the AirPods reproduce a wider soundstage than most Bluetooth earbuds without being any thicker or protruding from the ear. Yes, the AirPods are designed for function first, in spite of their stylized appearance.

* Microsoft retiring from its bold goal is just a part of trying and failing to woo consumers for years, and it’s part of a recent broader retreat over the past year. Now that Microsoft has moved the fundamental core of Windows over to the cloud team, it’s easy to see the long-term future of Windows being a cloud subscription service for the people who really need to use it, rather than love using it. Bill Gates figured out how to put a computer on every desk and in every home, and now the company is ready to grow and tackle the future. It’s not the old and trusted Windows operating system that will get Microsoft there.

* But Facebook is a different beast. Uber had a convenient alternative in Lyft, a near-identical product with a better ethical track record and fewer problematic executives. For those who didn’t want to use ride-sharing at all, our society has innumerable ways to move from A to B, from taxis to public transportation to cycling to walking, and so on. For heavy Facebook users, there is no such substitute: for many users, following through on a boycott would require substantial changes to one’s social and cultural behavior on a daily basis. For many people, Facebook and its ecosystem is the online analog to the real world, and deleting yourself from that space comes at too great a cost.

* In a widely shared Twitter thread, Chollet argues that Facebook is capable of “mass population control” on the political level, and its AI doesn’t even need to be that sophisticated. This is possible, he argues, because our lives are increasingly lived online, and that gives Facebook massive power to guide what we see. Our “static” brains are vulnerable to being influenced, and there’s no way to fight it. AI is getting smarter, and the world hasn’t ended yet because we’re still bad at AI.

* One of the keys to the Switch’s appeal for developers is Nintendo’s attitude and the relative ease of developing for the Switch. In the past, it’s been hard for smaller creators to even get in touch with the company, and once they did, platforms like the Wii U weren’t exactly simple to develop for. But that’s changed with the Switch. Since launch, the console has supported Unity and Unreal Engine, the two biggest middleware game engines, and this week, the company also announced support for Game Maker Studio. The question now is how long things can last. Other platforms, like the iPhone and Steam, have been similarly great for indie games. But eventually, as the platform matures and it starts to become saturated with new releases, it becomes less viable.
