# Fascinating Technology Commentary (November 2018)

* There was an Olympics this year. Black Panther, too. If that surprises you to remember — as it surprises me — that’s because so much else has happened since. (“Everything happens so much,” wrote the Twitter account @horse_ebooks in the summer of 2012, which is as good a motto for these days as any.) Things are speeding up, or at least they seem to be.

* But my favorite part of the click wheel is also the part that we’ve lost the most since we switched to touch-enabled devices: the ability to use it without looking at the screen. It’s a small thing, but a significant one. Today’s devices demand our constant attention: they’re almost impossible to use without it, in fact.

* In April 2011, Ben Horowitz wrote a popular blog post about war and business. There are two kinds of CEOs, said the entrepreneur and cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz. There’s the “peacetime” CEO, best represented by Eric Schmidt during Google’s charmed first decade. And then there’s the “wartime” CEO — the one facing an existential threat. Incoming Google CEO Larry Page, he argued, was a wartime CEO — with Facebook ascendant, Page would have to adopt a more combative mindset. Seven years later, it’s Facebook’s CEO facing an existential threat.

* There was always something distasteful about Amazon’s quest to find a home for its HQ2. Even when it seemed like it might be a fair fight, it was depressing to watch so many cities and towns prostrating themselves before a tech giant in hopes they would score a windfall of jobs and infrastructure investments.

* There’s any number of practical reasons why this could be the case. It might simply be a matter of size — Face ID’s array of sensors might be thicker or wider than Apple can fit in its laptop displays — or maybe Face ID would add costs.

* Being perma-banned is a death sentence for people who survive on attention. [Laura Loomer’s protest proved her days as a provocateur are over - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18119993/social-media-platform-perma-ban-twitter-facebook-laura-loomer)
