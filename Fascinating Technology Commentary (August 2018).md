# Fascinating Technology Commentary (August 2018)

* The big picture this paints is of a legacy retail brand — one of the biggest on the planet — that’s now fiercely hungry to compete and stay relevant in a world moving slowly but surely toward online commerce, on-demand delivery, and bundled services. [Amazon and Walmart’s rivalry is reshaping how we’ll buy everything in the future  - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17630604/amazon-walmart-competition-tech-partnerships-grocery-delivery)
* Time spent online is largely time spent feeling jaded, with brief interruptions for grimaces (seeing a bad post) and half-smiles (seeing a good one). Rare is the content that can evoke a genuine feeling. And yet, there’s so much of it! Given that most of us are connected to the internet most of the time — desktops and laptops at work and school; smartphones at work and school and home and anywhere else that has a viable cellular connection — that means mindless boredom has reached an unimaginable scale, and that it’s simultaneously way more profound than it was in the ’90s, when it was a dominant cultural force. (And anyway, now that everyone’s online, good posts are becoming harder to find.) That uniquely internet feeling can be isolating in a way that’s hard to describe; I think it’s why social platforms exist, and why the main virtue of the ‘net is relatability, which is just a restatement of the human need to connect. This is all a long way of saying that it’s easy to feel alone, even when you’re with everyone else on the planet.

* Going public means something else, too: financial disclosures. If real Gs move in silence, like lasagna, public companies move like belled cats. “Musk prefers to operate in secrecy,” Vance wrote. Musk told Bloomberg News in January 2015 that “there’s a lot of noise that surrounds a public company and people are constantly commenting on the share price and value. Being public definitely increases the management overhead for any given enterprise.” [For Elon Musk, the worst part of a publicly traded company was the public - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17664296/elon-musk-tesla-public-private-offering-stocks)
* Each platform comes with its own rules and Terms of Service. In a sense, these are political documents of their own: miniaturized corporate constitutions that can be amended over time to fit the needs of shareholders and users. Twitter is not Facebook any more than the United States is Canada. Just as countries are their governing documents, so are companies in relation to their Terms of Service. Twitter’s problem is that it’s never really stuck to a guide or agreed on how to enforce it.

* Still, there’s something in me that just loves the ingenuity and sheer chutzpah it takes for someone to chop up the Samsung logo and assemble a brand name from the fragments. [SHAASUIVG is my new favorite tech brand - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/8/9/17669924/shaasuivg-counterfeit-china-pinduoduo-copycat)
* Long before phone addiction panic gripped the masses and before screen time became a facet of our wellness and digital detoxes, there was one good and wise piece of technology that served our families. Maybe it was in the family room or in the kitchen. It could have been a Mac or PC. Chances are it had a totally mesmerizing screensaver. It was the shared family desktop. [How the shared family computer protected us from our worst selves - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/9/17661466/shared-family-computer)
* In the early 18th century, satirist Jonathan Swift observed, “Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it, so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too late; the jest is over, and the tale hath had its effect… like a physician, who hath found out an infallible medicine, after the patient is dead.” [Twitter is wrong about Alex Jones: facts are not enough to combat conspiracy theories - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/10/17675232/twitter-alex-jones-jack-dorsey-free-speech)
* It turns out, the main utility of the Vector robot is something we don’t talk about very much in tech, its fun. [Vector: Anki’s tiny robot that wants to hang - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBiNaro5pAU)
* As more companies move toward launching their own proprietary subscription streaming services, the future hasn’t been entirely decided yet, but new clues are emerging, pointing toward a potentially surprising answer: all this disruptive new media is just gradually re-creating familiar old-media models. [Netflix, Amazon Video, and Xfinity are accidentally re-creating cable TV - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17672176/netflix-amazon-prime-video-xfinity-deals-old-media-disruption-recreating-cable)
* Luke Oakden-Rayner, a radiologist who’s written extensively on the subject, says advances in AI are fast pushing us toward a tipping point where software is no longer a tool that’s applied and interpreted by a doctor, but something that makes decisions on behalf of humans. [DeepMind’s AI can detect over 50 eye diseases as accurately as a doctor - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17670156/deepmind-ai-eye-disease-doctor-moorfields)
* Being without a phone means being without human contact, help lines, and entertainment. Yes, we’ve lived without on-demand access to these things in the past — but that’s the past. They’re normal now. [The constant stress of the battery meter   - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/8/17/17716330/battery-meter-stress-nomophobia)
* Nothing defines Twitter so thoroughly as its bias toward inaction. [Twitter’s fear of making hard decisions is killing it - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/17/17706256/twitter-alex-jones-third-party-apps-hard-decisions)
*  Under Costolo, the company decided that its future lay in Facebook-style feed advertising, which meant consolidating everything into a single native app it could control. But rather than kill off third-party apps for good, it introduced a series of half-measures designed to bleed them out slowly: denying them new features, for example, or capping the number of users they could acquire by limiting their API tokens. While this spared some amount of yelling in the short term, the move — which was still hugely unpopular with a vocal segment of the user base — needlessly prolonged the agony.

* But when bots became available the public, the public largely shrugged. The advantages of conversational interfaces paled next to their drawbacks. It turned out that typing into text boxes — often while trying to guess the appropriate commands — felt frustrating compared to the visual interfaces people were used to. And so bots largely receded into the background as another Silicon Valley innovation that arrived before its time. [Bots didn’t flop; they just became invisible - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17689322/bots-comeback-intercom-eoghan-mccabe-interview-converge-podcast)
* Qi in theory has competitors like PMA, the other major charging standard out there. But with Apple exclusively supporting Qi with the iPhone X and 8, other standards are essentially dead in the water (we’re already seeing former PMA holdouts like Powermat add Qi support), and for all intents and purposes, Qi is the future of wireless charging.  [The best wireless charger to buy right now - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie)
* What’s striking to me is how quickly the way we talk about these products has changed. In August 2017, we talked of $1,000 iPhones with the same air of incredulity with which we — I, in particular — treated the alien-looking AirPods when they were first revealed. In August 2018, we speak of pricey phones in the same way we discuss AirPods today: different, not for everyone, but worth it for those who decide to take the plunge. [In less than a year, the $1,000 phone has become entirely normal - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763322/iphone-x-galaxy-note-9-smartphone-pricing-2018)
* The preeminence of Google Assistant at IFA this year will be in large part because most manufacturers that wanted to build Alexa into their devices have already done so and made those announcements. Google is still catching up. But, in classic Google fashion, the Mountain View company is doing so at a formidable pace, and it stands a good chance of eventually surpassing Amazon with the help of network effects from its other ubiquitously used services.

* The success of artificial intelligence in this domain is thanks to one of the technology’s core strengths: its ability to uncover previously overlooked patterns in complex datasets. [Google and Harvard team up to use deep learning to predict earthquake aftershocks - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/30/17799356/ai-predict-earthquake-aftershocks-google-harvard)
* For a company like Tesla, stories really matter. Since Tesla has never had a yearly profit, it is essentially peddling hope — the hope that the company will become profitable.
