# Fascinating Technology Commentary (June 2019)

* “Striking Vipers” does get at the deep fantasy underlying so may virtual worlds, the way a layer of plausible remove can keep wish-fulfillment fantasies from being too embarrassingly naked. Everyone who’s gotten a little emotionally invested in what their on-screen character is doing, whether it’s punching bad guys in a fighting game or navigating more complicated emotional waters, has gotten a taste of what’s going on here — the appeal of an imaginary world where it’s safe to play out a fantasy. The episode just contends, more than most video gamer stories do, with the potential real-world cost of living in a fantasy and the potential dreariness of living solely in a world of responsibility and work, without any fantasy to liven it up.

* The seventh-generation iPod touch: it’s a device that’s rooted in Apple’s past, not its future. [Apple’s new iPod touch isn’t for the converted; it’s for the nonbelievers - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656480/apple-ipod-touch-7th-generation-2019-update-review)
* have come to believe that using a secure chat app is increasingly a moral imperative, and I have failed utterly and completely to convince enough people in my social network to switch to a third party, end-to-end encrypted chat app. [Using secure chat is a moral imperative, and iMessage is my best option - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts)
* With the release of the mid-range Pixel 3A smartphone this year, Google has created some space for itself to make something top of the line from both a software*and*a hardware perspective.

* Calibra is how Facebook intends to make money off Libra, a digital currency it says it does not want to control, despite having created it. More generally, it’s a massive play for Facebook to get into financial services in a way that no other technology company may be able to compete with. Think of it as the Bank of Facebook — an arm of the social network that hopes to do for loans, credit, money transfer, and commerce what its suite of apps has done for online communication.

* Tablets simply aren’t a priority for Google. Not being a company-wide priority isn’t necessarily a problem for most consumer products — lots of little experiments at Google find success. But I think that when you’re trying to build a*platform,*not being a priority is the same as unbeing. It’s a death sentence.

* Only Immanuel Kant’s famously difficult “Critique of Pure Reason” registers a more challenging readability score than Facebook’s privacy policy.  [Opinion | We Read 150 Privacy Policies.

* Silicon Valley’s characteristically agile values, for example Facebook’s with its “build fast and break things” mentality, the companies leave no time for consideration about the long term impacts of their products and how it will affect the world.

* I use a trick with co-workers when we’re trying to decide where to eat for lunch and no one has any ideas. I recommend McDonald’s. An interesting thing happens. Everyone unanimously agrees that we can’t possibly go to McDonald’s, and better lunch suggestions emerge. Magic! It’s as if we’ve broken the ice with the worst possible idea, and now that the discussion has started, people suddenly get very creative. I call it the McDonald’s Theory: people are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones.

* Simply put: there’s just no magic left in the AR collectible formula. [Harry Potter: Wizards Unite is missing the Pokémon Go magic - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable)
* There are two people replacing Ive, not one. They report to the COO, not directly to Tim Cook. That is precisely the opposite of how Steve Jobs had set up Jony Ive at Apple. [Apple and the end of the genius - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/18870887/apple-jony-ive-design-genius-committee)
* Nevertheless, Jony Ive’s departure will have real consequences. The first consequence isn’t Apple’s problem, it’s ours: we should stop thinking of Apple as the singular expression of one person’s genius.
