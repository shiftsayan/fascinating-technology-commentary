# Fascinating Technology Commentary (May 2018)

* Mostly though, the NUC 8 isn’t supposed to be something that many people buy. It exists to show off what can be done with a small form-factor PC. And thanks to Intel and AMD’s new partnership, it turns out you can do quite a lot.

* In Detroit last year, US Secretary Elaine Chao said it’s vital for the auto industry to ensure that self-driving cars help improve life in rural communities and not just urban areas. “We want to be inclusive as well and consider how this technology can benefit rural America,” Chao said during the 2017 Detroit Auto Show. The question is: what is the use-case for self-driving cars in rural communities? Most of the leading companies, like Waymo and GM, are pursuing commercial ride-hailing businesses using autonomous vehicles. Robotaxis are seen as the best way to bring autonomous technology to the most people in the shortest time frame.

* All of the Android P advantages exhibited by Google at I/O 2018 will be the exclusive preserve of two classes of devices: new ones bought after the release of Android P and slightly older ones that were too expensive for their manufacturers to get away with not updating. [What do we even mean when we say ‘Android’? - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/11/17343510/google-android-p-google-io-2018)
* But it certainly does make the case that Google knows how to use this world-changing technology in productive, meaningful ways to yield tangible benefits for the public. Google is already arguably the best platform for helping people find information on the internet and get around in the real world. It’s clear now that a little bit of AI can go a long way in helping us achieve both those goals in new, more remarkable ways. [AI is Google’s secret weapon for remaking Maps and News - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/10/17340004/google-ai-maps-news-secret-weapon-remaking-old-apps-products-io-2018)
* Google unveiled the next stage for Material Design. Explicitly not called “Material Design 2,” it is instead a suite of tools and guidelines for designers to extend and expand the Material Design philosophy with their own brand styles. In essence, Google wants to keep the functionality of Material Design to maintain consistency across apps, but give developers tools to adapt it to their design needs. [Google’s software design is having a reformation - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/10/17339230/google-material-design-theme-update-new-tools-matias-duarte)
* his year, Google is doing something different with Android. Instead of showing you all the ways you can use its phone operating system to do more, it’s creating features to help you use it less. [Exclusive: Android P is Google’s most ambitious update in years - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17327302/android-p-update-new-features-changes-video-google-io-2018)
* Every company in Silicon Valley will tell you, with operatic grandeur, that it aims to change the world and make it a better place. But set aside the pretenders trying to sell you $400 juicers, Google happens to be a company that can actually alter the way we, as a global society, interact with and understand one another. Google has control over the world’s dominant search engine, web browser, video and email platforms, mapping service, and mobile operating system. The decisions made by this company have far-reaching effects, and Google I/O 2018 presented a vision of the future that makes Google even more personal, influential, and essential in our daily lives. What Google I/O asks of us every year is to trust Google that little bit more. Let Google handle that one more task, let it know that extra snippet of personal information so it can more intelligently assist us. [At I/O, Google showed its willingness to change and shape our lives - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17334632/google-io-2018-personal-assistant)
* With Google’s AI assistant making calls on our behalf, I worry it will become easier for us to abuse small businesses. If it’s as simple as telling Google Duplex to make an appointment, it’s just as easy to constantly reschedule or not show up altogether because there’s no connection between you and the human worker who picked up the phone to arrange your reservation. You don’t feel bad for the number of requests and changes when someone (or something) else is doing it for you. [Google Duplex is Silicon Valley’s latest experiment at the expense of the service industry - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17335710/google-duplex-phone-call-ai-assistant-service-industry)
* Windows might still be here, but after talking to Nadella, I did get the sense that Windows is no longer as central to the company’s future plans as it once was. Instead of trying to make everything run on Windows (as his predecessor Steve Ballmer was trying to do), Nadella wants to ensure that everything can work with Windows. [Exclusive: How Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is rethinking Windows - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17324920/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-interview-windows-10-build-2018)
* Build is a chance to show off the good bits of the new Microsoft and where exactly the company will be heading in the next five years. Vague promises of AI and quantum computing won’t be enough without a good demonstration of its software prowess in action. Microsoft has the opportunity to show the world this week what it really stands for and why people should still care. [Microsoft needs to prove it’s not another IBM - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17325540/microsoft-build-conference-2018-preview)
* The top alternatives to Google’s Chrome browser are either limited in availability — Safari, which doesn’t run on Windows or Android — or ad-supported, as in the case of Firefox and Opera. So you’re either sacrificing privacy, device compatibility, or your own attention, depending on which trade-off you choose to make. It may be an annoyance to be confronted with such a choice, but it just goes to show that nothing useful on the internet is ever free. [Firefox is adding ads, because only insults are free - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17326184/firefox-ads-sponsored-content-pocket-suggestions)
* If the idea of wearing both a VR headset and headphones sounds claustrophobic, the SoundWear Companion can be a good alternative for the audio side of things that’ll have you feeling less closed off to the real world. [Bose SoundWear Companion neck speaker review - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17311570/bose-soundwear-companion-review-neck-speaker-bluetooth)
* A real problem for the Tinder platform is successfully getting users to coordinate first dates. At this point, the Tinder pen pal has become a classic archetype. [Facebook could beat Tinder just by getting users to meet in real life - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308662/facebook-dating-app-events-tinder)
* When websites become useless, they become a reminder of what was lost when the internet gained purpose, function, and profit. We are all still searching for an online space where we can yell our secrets and be unseen and disappear. These opportunities now often exist only in dying online spaces, the last place where no one is looking. [Snapchat’s decline and the secret joy of internet ghost towns - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/18/17366528/snapchat-decline-internet-ghost-towns)
* But at least one immediate effect of that cultural shift is a CEO that is much less cavalier about the lives of the so-called “partner drivers.” Instead of treating them like a problem to be overcome with self-driving cars, he emphasized that “machines augment humans” and that “ultimately our network is going to be a machine network and a human network together.”  [Uber in ‘discussions’ to get Waymo self-driving cars on its network - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/31/17406956/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-waymo-self-driving-code-conference-2018)
* This is all part of Oculus’ broader entertainment push to make VR both a social experience and a medium that goes beyond just gaming. To do that, Oculus needs to give everyday consumers a reason to own a VR headset and use it regularly. [Oculus launches live entertainment app Venues for Oculus Go and Gear VR headsets - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17407222/oculus-go-venues-launch-samsung-gear-vr-live-entertainment)
* Pravda is insidious precisely because it would allow its users — or at least its loudest ones — to redefine truth. It would be easy to manipulate because it ignores every lesson we’ve learned about the internet. [Elon Musk wants to crowdsource truth, but that’s not how the internet works - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17390208/elon-musk-pravda-journalism-truth)
* The promise of the web is complicated, but its most intriguing aspect was always allowing niche communities to gather together and share what they loved. There was a place for everyone, whether you wanted to talk about obscure British punk bands, conspiracy theories, bacon, folklore, the best fan ships, weird memes, or Star Wars. People were encouraged to experiment, no matter how pointless the outcome appeared to be. You just needed a way to find it.
