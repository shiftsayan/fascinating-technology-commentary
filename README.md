# Fascinating Technology Commentary

For almost 2 years, from August 2017 to September 2019, with varying success I kept track of fascinating technology commentary I came across on popular technology news websites and Twitter feeds. I since have given up this practice because it became more of a time commitment than it was worth but I hope this repository can be home to some interest thoughts on technology.

Here's an example from The Verge.

> What if the show [Silicon Valley] has never been as pessimistic as it seems? Maybe the stories have never been about “heroes” and “villains.” It’s a despairingly dark comedy, illustrating how talented-but-ruthless people screw each other over and keep a potential technological utopia at bay. But maybe it’s also been a clear-eyed look at how humanity keeps progressing in spite of ourselves.
