# Fascinating Technology Commentary (January 2018)

* Did you know that inside Google, the employees sometimes call those bubbles “the poodle?” It’s true! It looks like half a poodle, I guess, if you squint. Also, if you say “Hey Poodle” instead of “Hey Google” is mostly works about half the time — and it’s a lot more fun to say.

* There were plenty of demos of things that linked multiple commands together to perform various actions, but Google’s idea of an Assistant-enabled home is less of a smart home and more of a remote control home. The demos are impressive, but none of them are proactive in the way a true smart home would be. [Google’s CES exhibit is meant to indoctrinate you in the ways of the Assistant - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16880594/ces-2018-google-exhibit-booth-tour-photo-essay)
* It’s tempting to view the changes as a potential solution to the way hoaxes and propaganda can spread virally on Facebook, even after a year of heavy criticism. And yet it seems possible that these changes by themselves would do little to address the issue. Fake news often goes viral precisely because of the strong engagement that it generates from partisans on both sides. This move could strengthen filter bubbles rather than weaken them. [Facebook says it plans to transform the News Feed to promote “meaningful posts” - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions)
* It may seem strange that Google, a company that’s generally seen as the forerunner in commercial AI, was not able to come up with a more complete solution to this error. But it’s a good reminder of how difficult it can be to train AI software to be consistent and robust. Especially (as one might suppose happened in the case of the Google Photos mistake) when that software is not trained and tested by a diverse group of people. [Google ‘fixed’ its racist algorithm by removing gorillas from its image-labeling tech - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai)
* And even if Facebook succeeds at phasing the news media out of the News Feed, it’s not clear it will make Facebook a happier place. Facebook-owned WhatsApp has no news feed, and yet hoaxes and propaganda still run rampant. The company will face continued pressure to address misinformation across all of its platforms. Detaching conversations from article links won’t necessarily make them more accurate, productive, or even more “meaningful.” It may well make them worse. Still, it’s notable that a company that has done nothing but grow now finds itself tapping the brakes. The decade-long project to expand around the world has brought about consequences with no easy solutions. For maybe the first time in its existence, Facebook has seen the value of moving slowly. [Facebook’s startling new ambition is to shrink - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/14/16885314/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions)
* Future AI archaeologists may, however, dismiss most of our works about the rise of the machines as hopelessly, intrinsically anthropocentric: stories by us, for us, about us. Thought-provoking, even moving stories, but that’s it. The problem is built right into the premise. When the machine takeover happens, it’s not going to matter what we think about it, how we feel about it. That would be like telling the story of the Industrial Revolution from the perspective of dolphins. If and when the AI revolution happens, Homo sapiens is not going to be the protagonist of that story. In fact, there’s no reason to think it will resemble a story at all.

* Another neat feature that you don’t have to speak Chinese to appreciate is the feedback DuerOS gives following the initial “Xiaodu xiaodu” wake word — the assistant instantly makes human-sounding noises of acknowledgment like “mm?,” which comes across as friendlier than an anonymous bloop. [Baidu and Teenage Engineering’s smart speaker is a stylish Chinese Echo - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/16/16876906/baidu-raven-h-teenage-engineering-ces-2018)
* Some products don’t really benefit from a Bluetooth chip and an app, though. Milanesi also observed that a smart pet scoop that tells other family members whether the pet has been fed is only “solving” our own laziness or communication issues.

* And it’s not just privacy and security that people need to think about. There’s also lock-in. You can’t just buy a connected gadget, you have to choose an ecosystem to live in. Does it work with HomeKit? Will it work with Alexa? Will some tech company get into a spat with another tech company and pull its services from that hardware thing you just bought?

* Because market manipulation has helped push cryptocurrencies to dizzy, grossly inflated heights, the recent falls in value have been similarly spectacular. But unlike with previous drops, the newly emerging drive to regulate the cryptocurrency market could hobble a recovery. Assuming that the likes of the SEC and FINRA begin clamping down on fraudulent trading practices, and assuming that these practices were vital to Bitcoin’s precipitous rise, then Bitcoin may very well struggle to climb as quickly in 2018 as it did in 2017. Not only will the parties responsible for manipulative trading be inclined to sell their ill-gotten gains and run, but an increasing number of people will fully realize that the cryptocurrency market is a hive of dubious activity.

* Positive reinforcement is the engine that drives so many tech companies. This strategy is sometimes called “gamification,” and it’s meant to make apps “sticky” so you’ll keep using them. [The Apple Watch wants to alter your behavior - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16926350/apple-watch-series-2-fitness-tracker-healthy-notification-behavior)
* The goal of Time Well Spent is to reverse what it calls “the digital attention crisis” — the brilliant minds at Google, Apple, Facebook, and elsewhere who “hijack our minds” through ever-more sophisticated manipulation techniques delivered through our smartphones. [‘Time well spent’ is shaping up to be tech’s next big debate - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16903844/time-well-spent-facebook-tristan-harris-mark-zuckerberg)
* The aphorism “Easy enough to do with your eyes closed,” simply doesn’t apply to our technology anymore, because no matter how intuitive the operating system, the very nature of the hardware demands your full visual attention. [Pebble is dead and hardware buttons are going with it - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/27/16936922/pebble-smartwatch-hardware-button-physical-controls)
* The iPhone X’s gestures, which replace the functions of the home button found on every prior iPhone, are the most intuitive, natural, and, frankly, fun interactions I’ve ever had using a smartphone. They are so useful that it takes merely a day using the iPhone X to never want to go back to a home button. [Every phone should copy the iPhone X’s gestures - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/31/16953502/iphone-x-gestures-copy-android-oneplus-editorial)
* Younger children are simply not ready to have social media accounts,” the letter reads. “They also do not have a fully developed understanding of privacy, including what’s appropriate to share with others and who has access to their conversations, pictures, and videos. At a time when there is mounting concern about how social media use affects adolescents’ well-being, it is particularly irresponsible to encourage children as young as preschoolers to start using a Facebook product.” [Facebook should shut down Messenger Kids, child advocates say - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16950932/child-health-advocates-urge-facebook-shut-down-messenger-kids-mark-zuckerberg)
* You’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise because of their name, but chatbots can’t really chat. As researchers from Facebook’s FAIR lab explain in a pre-print paper published this week, they fail at this task on a number of levels. First, they don’t display a “consistent personality,” sticking to the same set of facts about themselves throughout a conversation; second, they don’t remember what they or their conversational partners have said in the past; and third, when faced with a question they don’t understand, they tend to fall back on diversionary or preprogrammed responses, like “I don’t know.” [Facebook is trying to teach chatbots how to chit-chat - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/28/16935700/chatbots-facebook-chit-chit-small-talk-fair-research)
