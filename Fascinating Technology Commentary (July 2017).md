* Apple’s uniqueness isn’t in making absolutely everything good and right about the iPhone, but in creating the circumstances in which those good things could come to be.

* The fact that Apple succeeded in nurturing an app store into an App Store and turning an iPhone into just iPhone, no article required, is to Apple’s own enduring credit.

* Traditional media is still trying to navigate the landscape of online video, unsure of where its territory ends and the realm of YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and seemingly arcane subcultures begin. [CBS’s Candy Crush show misunderstands why people love video games - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15953394/cbs-live-action-candy-crush-twitch-game-streaming-misunderstanding)
* The artificial world of studio television might try to feed off a viral video's success, but there’s a reason it so rarely translates well. The lights, the camera, and the army of PAs can’t replicate the essence of the internet video laugh track: sincerity.

* But in mobile, there’s no greater woulda-coulda-shoulda than Windows Phone. Everything that made Android successful was stuff that Microsoft was basically already trying to do. It’s just that Microsoft did it not quite as well, not quite as free, and way too late. [Android killed Windows Phone, not Apple - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/14/15970082/google-killed-windows-phone-not-iphone)

* It’s striking how little of this online “laughter” has to do with humor. These days, linguists might say online laughter has more of a “discourse function” just as one might say “mm-hm” in the course of a conversation. [Laugh and the World Laughs With You. Type ‘Ha,’ Not So Much. - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/style/laughing-online-lol-hahahaha.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fcommand-z)
* People don’t pick up each other’s digital laughter in quite the same way they do in real life; it is called “behavioral mimicry.” So online laughter is very much like a fingerprint, which is actually very much like real life. You recognize people’s laughs.  [Laugh and the World Laughs With You. Type ‘Ha,’ Not So Much. - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/style/laughing-online-lol-hahahaha.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fcommand-z)

* Autonomy, electrification, design, OTA software updates, and a boot-to-bonnet commitment to technology — Tesla touched all these vectors first, making them cool and important and inextricable parts of the auto industry.

*  In essence, the Model 3 turns the car’s entire human interface into software. It’s alien to us as a car interior, just as it was once alien as a phone interface — how do you speed-dial anyone without buttons — but Tesla is betting that we’ll adapt to it over time just as we did with phones.
