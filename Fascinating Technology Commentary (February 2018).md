# Fascinating Technology Commentary (February 2018)

* After a few months of tweaking the News Feed in order to make it more personal and harder for fake stories to spread, Facebook says that overall usage has dropped by “roughly 50 million hours every day.” [Facebook usage falls in the US as it begins to tinker with the News Feed - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/31/16956818/facebook-q4-2017-earnings-50-million-hours-reduced-usage)
* It may be hard for people outside of China to grasp just how influential WeChat has become there. “For all intents and purposes WeChat is your phone, and to a far greater extent in China than anywhere else, your phone is everything,” wrote Ben Thompson, consultant and founder of the blog Stratechery. “There is nothing in any other country that is comparable: not LINE, not WhatsApp, not Facebook.” [How WeChat came to rule China - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16721230/wechat-china-app-mini-programs-messaging-electronic-id-system)
* Every new Marvel movie is an opportunity for a new direction, a chance for the studio to refresh its formula and bring in new elements. For the last few years, those elements have mostly been comedic (Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man) or satirical (Thor: Ragnarok). With Black Panther, Coogler doesn’t try to distinguish himself by making a sillier movie than his predecessors did. He clearly aspired to make something better, something deeper and more meaningful [Black Panther review: the grown-up Marvel movie we’ve been waiting for - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16977756/black-panther-movie-review-ryan-coogler-marvel-cinematic-universe-chadwick-boseman-michael-b-jordan)
* Tightly tying hardware to software and services is at the core of Apple’s DNA, so complaining about Spotify might seem ridiculous here. The iPod didn’t work so well with other music stores, after all. But streaming music services really just offer access to music, especially on a screenless device you control with your voice. It doesn’t matter if you’re paying Spotify or Apple or Tidal when you ask for a song; you just want it to play. Apple Music doesn’t make the HomePod better in any particular way — just more limited.

* Is Musk’s space car art? It’s a problem that faces any gesture absurd or excessive enough. The car doesn’t fulfill a coherent function (besides marketing), it’s a creative gesture driven by an individual’s vision, and it’s a primarily visual phenomenon: ipso facto. [Elon Musk made history launching a car into space. Did he make art too? - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/10/16997124/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-art-starman-advertising)
* This is a strange time for social media. It’s possible to do more than just earn a living by being popular online; young people with no real work experience can make millions of dollars. But it’s an entirely new field, the rules are ill-defined and constantly changing, and the systems reward provocateurs over creators who carefully consider and moderate their impact. The term “influencer” still prompts sneers; there’s a stigma associated with vloggers and social-media stars, a perception that they’re freeloaders with no work ethic, who tweet all day and have no real skills.

* Although both of the latter devices have been well-received, it’s not clear Apple’s traditional way of tackling new product categories will help it succeed in AR or VR, where companies like Microsoft and Facebook have been pouring billions into acquisitions, research, and product development. [Apple smart glasses patent details a lighter, comfier head-mounted display - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/9/16996778/apple-smart-glasses-ar-patent-design)
* Tesla is a study in highs and lows. [Tesla faces a critical year, but Elon Musk is obsessed with the future - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16990730/tesla-earnings-2017-elon-musk)
* This breeds a sort of media nihilism, a belief that no audiovisual content can ever be definitively said to be “real.” This attitude was visible on the r/deepfakes subreddit, where users who pasted celebrity faces onto pornographic clips argued that they were, in a way, helping people. By improving the face-swapping technology, they were eroding definitions of real and fake, which would stop people from being targeted by actual revenge porn. “Legitimate homemade sex movies used as revenge porn can be waved off as fakes,” said one popular post. “If anything can be real, nothing is real.” [The crackdown on face-swapped porn shows we aren’t powerless against AI fakes - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16990076/ai-fakes-deepfakes-video-media)
* Like Steve Jobs pulling the original MacBook Air out of a manila envelope back in 2008, the Tesla onboard the Falcon Heavy rocket was not strictly necessary to make the event impressive. But the car’s presence and expert presentation is what elevated that event, it’s what many of us will remember most vividly, and its continuing joyride through space will keep reminding us of the feat. [Sending a Tesla into space wasn’t such a dumb idea - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/2/7/16984284/tesla-space-falcon-heavy-launch-elon-musk)
* It’s no secret that voice assistants are a Trojan horse. You “buy” a voice assistant like an Echo Dot or a Google Home, and you plug it in and give it your Wi-Fi password. But you don’t “own” it like you own a computer. The software is controlled entirely by Amazon or Google or some other company. [Amazon owns my Echo; I’m just feeding it - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/17/17020962/amazon-echo-alexa-trojan-horse-sad-dreams)
* Our culture of screen crack stigma and obsessive warranty paranoia, as well as the sheer ubiquity and the marketing prowess of the mobile accessories industry has made it very easy to forget that it was someone’s job to test the aesthetics of the Phone X. So many days, weeks, and months went into these Jobs-ian pursuits of perfection, and so many times they are wasted on an increasingly shrinking portion of people who feel comfortable not encasing their phones in high-impact polycarbonate. [The case for using the iPhone X without a case - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/18/17021710/apple-iphone-x-smartphone-case-design-dangers-caseless)
* Calling out “Apple and other tech giants,” Gates argues that companies are inviting government intervention by flaunting hubris, saying they need to be “careful that they’re not trying to think their view is more important than the government’s view, or than the government being able to function in some key areas.” [Bill Gates says big tech companies are inviting government regulation - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17009146/bill-gates-big-tech-companies-apple-inviting-government-regulation)
* This callous attitude toward a potentially game-changing, life-saving, and paradigm-shifting technology like autonomous vehicles is extremely troubling. A pirate mentality has infected companies in the autonomous vehicle space. “Move fast and break things” may have worked as an ethos for Uber when it was trying to overcome entrenched interests like the taxi industry, but it’s exactly the opposite philosophy you want to hear from a company that wants you to ride in its driverless cars. [The Waymo v. Uber trial has shaken my confidence in self-driving cars - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/16996864/waymo-vs-uber-trial-settlement-self-driving-car-confidence)
* Whether you want to track its lineage back to the Palm Pre, Nokia N9, or BlackBerry whatever, the iPhone X’s gesture interface in iOS 11 is a well-lubricated triumph. There is pure kinetic joy in swiping up from the bottom of the phone to summon the home screen, or sideways to switch between apps. I marvel at the fluidity and beauty of this human-machine interface. It’s fast, unerringly smooth, and unfailingly satisfying to use.

* Many of us on the political left, desperate for a heroine in difficult times, were eager to put Manning on a pedestal — elevating her to the sort of suffocating heights that almost inevitably precede a fall.  [We need to talk about Chelsea Manning - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16976180/chelsea-manning-alt-right)
* Uber is trying its best to cast Google as a has-been in the race for self-driving cars, crippled by massive attrition and brain drain. Waymo v. Uber, they’re trying to say, isn’t about trade secrets, but about the market scarcity for expertise in self-driving cars [The battle of the damning emails begins with Waymo v. Uber opening statements - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16975878/waymo-v-uber-trial-opening-statements-travis-kalanick-emails)
* It may be hard for people outside of China to grasp just how influential WeChat has become there. “For all intents and purposes WeChat is your phone, and to a far greater extent in China than anywhere else, your phone is everything,” wrote Ben Thompson, consultant and founder of the blog Stratechery [How WeChat came to rule China - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16721230/wechat-china-app-mini-programs-messaging-electronic-id-system)
* I get the sense that iPhone X owners — even with the higher price, polarising notch, fragile glass back, and missing headphone jack — are universally pleased with their purchase. This is what makes Apple hard to criticise: satisfied customers. [The iPhone X is Apple’s underrated masterpiece - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16957594/iphone-x-apple-quarterly-report-review)
* When we ask IC Realtime about problems of how AI surveillance could be abused, they gave an answer that’s common in the tech industry: these technologies are value neutral, and it’s only how they’re implemented and by whom that makes them either good or bad.  [Artificial intelligence is going to supercharge surveillance - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16907238/artificial-intelligence-surveillance-cameras-security)
