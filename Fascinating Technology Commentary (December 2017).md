# Fascinating Technology Commentary (December 2017)

* 2017 was the year it became impossible to disassociate tech products from the humans and corporate cultures from which they sprung. [The Verge 2017 tech report card: Apple  - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16820306/2017-tech-recap-apple-iphone-x-tim-cook-ios-11-imac-tv)
* “Move fast and break things” is not a motto we need with technology that will wind its way into so many elements of so many lives. If 2017 was the year AI started showing up everywhere, 2018 has to be the year we think about why.

* John Gruber, author of the Daring Fireball blog and inventor of the Markdown publishing format, warns there could be more of this to come. “There is so much Chrome-only stuff right now,” says Gruber. “If you think Google isn’t building a proprietary Chrome platform, your head is in the sand.” [Chrome is turning into the new Internet Explorer 6 - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards)
* While on the surface Messenger Kids seems relatively innocuous, the underlying motive here cannot go unmentioned. Kids today have at their disposal a number of methods that allow them to communicate with friends and relatives, be it a traditional phone call, an email message, or perhaps even a text, if they have their own cell phone. What children don’t have access to is social networks like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and YouTube. That because’s of laws like COPPA, implemented because lawmakers determined that, without robust protections, it’s reasonable to think children will be exploited online by predators, advertisers, and others. Now Facebook is creating a pipeline for children to become regular users of its products, starting as young as six years old, by claiming to offer an alternative better than what it exists today.

* Events like 24 Hours of Reality are a bit like preaching to the choir — the people who are going to listen to the broadcast are probably the ones who already care about climate change. How are you trying to reach out to those who don’t care about climate change?
