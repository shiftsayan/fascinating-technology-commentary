* “Learning a language is a lot like going to the gym. Everybody kind of wants to do it, but when it comes down to it, the hardest thing is to keep yourself motivated,” von Ahn says. “Unlike going to a school where you’re essentially sort of forced to go, you’re in an app, where it’s very easy to go somewhere else.” [Duolingo redesigned its owl to guilt-trip you even harder - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137843/duolingo-owl-redesign-language-learning-app)
* I won’t guess the specifics, but I do think 2019 will see some sort of reckoning over Instagram.

* Which might explain why so many people are invested in Musk’s success. Unlike his peers, Musk is very available — especially on Twitter, as this year has demonstrated. It’s possible to see Musk make decisions, revamp decisions, and either charge ahead or backtrack in real time. (It’s possible that a lot of other companies experience the things that Musk shows us — without any of us ever the wiser.)
