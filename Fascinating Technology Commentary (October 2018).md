# Fascinating Technology Commentary (October 2018)

* The iPhone is simply too critical to Apple’s core business to risk the chaos of USB-C. It’s not acceptable to the company that someone would ever buy a pair of headphones or a charger and have it not work with their iPhone because the cable is bad or the wattage is too low or specs are not right.

* In recent months, many of technology’s biggest players, Google included, have grappled with the ethics of developing technology and products that may be used by the military, or that could contribute to the development of surveillance states in the US and abroad. Many of these technologies, like facial and image recognition, involve sophisticated uses of AI.

* Google putting a news feed on its massive homepage is a big deal: it could make the same mistakes Facebook and Twitter did with their feeds. It won't have social spread, maybe, but still it's a huge risk.

* “We can no longer afford to think short-term. We need more symbols for long-term thinking,” Bezos said. “I believe the clock will accomplish nothing for a few hundred years. We’ll build it and people will make fun of it for a long time.” [Jeff Bezos defends spending his Amazon billions on space travel - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17979418/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-travel-wired-25-summit)
* But Amazon is starting to move faster, and in the process its transforming from an e-commerce giant to a true, do-everything retail operation.

* The Pixel competes with the iPhone for mind share, not market share. [Why Google’s Pixel phones matter - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17978244/google-pixel-iphone-xs-camera-best-phone-android-sales-market-share)
* I’m perfectly at ease with bidding adieu to the metal smartphone. It was always a contradiction, anyway: a device intended to be constantly connected to everything around it probably shouldn’t be enclosed in a shell that makes wireless connections difficult. But the way that the entire mobile industry has decided that glass is the only alternative disappoints me. Glass is far from the perfect answer, phone makers shouldn’t accept it as such, and I hope 2019 brings back some of the design diversity that made smartphones so exciting in the first place.
