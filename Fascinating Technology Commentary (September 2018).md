# Fascinating Technology Commentary (September 2018)

* Sometimes, these videos get through simply because creators aren’t even trying to be disturbing — their creations are so smoothly wedged in the uncanny valley that an algorithm couldn’t possibly grasp just how hellish they are.

* Chrome’s future now looks more and more like a platform rather than its humble beginnings as a web browser. [Google’s Chrome browser is now 10 years old - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/2/17811844/google-chrome-browser-10-years-history)
* It’s all but impossible to show a consumer price increase when major internet services like Google and Facebook are free. Making a case for breaking up these companies will rely on showing a different type of harm than high consumer prices — something like anticompetitive practices, or that innovative businesses get suffocated when they’re absorbed by their gigantic acquirers.

* “In the past, I brought the new technology and differentiation to the flagship model and then moved to the mid-end. But I have changed my strategy from this year to bring technology and differentiation points starting from the mid-end,” Koh told CNBC.

* But according to Open Markets’ Matthew Stoller, the best long-term remedy for Google’s dominance has more to do with Google’s acquisitions. “If you’re looking for a silver bullet, probably the best thing to do would be to block Google from being able to buy any companies,” says Stoller. “Suddenly, you have to compete with Google, you can’t just be bought out by Google.” [The monopoly-busting case against Google, Amazon, Uber, and Facebook - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17805162/monopoly-antitrust-regulation-google-amazon-uber-facebook)
* Dorsey conceded the point. “I believe if you went through our rules today and sat down with a cup of coffee, you wouldn’t be able to understand them,” Dorsey said.

* Mirrorless cameras are no longer the preserve of second-rate companies who couldn’t compete against Canon and Nikon’s DSLR duopoly, but a crucial part of the future of high-end photography.

* The caricature of Zuckerberg is that of an automaton with little regard for the human dimensions of his work. The truth is something else: he decided long ago that no historical change is painless. Like Augustus, he is at peace with his trade-offs. Between speech and truth, he chose speech. Between speed and perfection, he chose speed. Between scale and safety, he chose scale. His life thus far has convinced him that he can solve “problem after problem after problem,” no matter the howling from the public it may cause.

* Back in 2014 when Apple acquired Beats, I wrote that part of the reason for the deal was that Apple needed an in to black culture, an area it would harness when it came time to launch its streaming music service.

* The point isn’t to wow you, though. The point is for Amazon to wow gadget makers with how simple, secure, and easy it is to integrate its Alexa Connection Kit. It’s a smart move for Amazon, and it’s increasing its lead as the de-facto hub of gadgets in your house.
