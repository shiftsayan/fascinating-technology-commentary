# Fascinating Technology Commentary (February 2019)

* But Apple didn’t wield all of its power. In theory, Apple could have banned Facebook from the consumer-facing App Store entirely — a possible catastrophe for the social platform. The showdown demonstrates how vulnerable the tech giants are to one another. [What would happen if Apple fully banned Facebook from the App Store? - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205291/apple-facebook-developer-ban-certificate-app-store)
* The problem with many of these tests isn’t necessarily that bots are too clever — it’s that humans suck at them. And it’s not that humans are dumb; it’s that humans are wildly diverse in language, culture, and experience. Once you get rid of all that stuff to make a test that*any*human can pass, without prior training or much thought, you’re left with brute tasks like image processing, exactly the thing a tailor-made AI is going to be good at.

* Amazon is a really elegant illustration of how the current framework in antitrust, the consumer welfare framework, really fails to capture forms of market power and forms of dominance that should be relevant to antitrust and do raise competition concerns.

* Here are three features Twitter could add to earn some trust: Batch Tweet Deletion, Self-Destructing Tweets, Swipe to Block.

* If it weren’t for the fact that I don’t yet trust Samsung to deliver major software updates quickly, I would be shouting about One UI from the rooftops. [Samsung’s One UI is the best software it’s ever put on a smartphone - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18229339/samsung-one-ui-update-android-9-pie-galaxy-s10-plus-s10e)
* But copying Apple was only a starting point, and Samsung’s most seminal Galaxy S device would come within a year of the first. The Galaxy S II was, and to this day remains, one of the absolute best Android phones ever made. If the first iteration was a harbinger, the second was the deliverer. [Samsung’s Galaxy S10 has to be more than an incremental upgrade - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18229565/samsung-galaxy-s10-s9-upgrade-apple-iphone-google-huawei-camera)
* We’ve written at length about the ways in which Chinese companies copy Apple’s iPhone hardware and interface designs, and there’s some justification to be derived from looking into the matter closely. In some cases, it just makes sense to adopt widely-recognized interactions or UI paradigms. Twitter, for instance, did exactly that when it changed its “favorite” button for a “like” — Jack Dorsey’s justification is that it is simply a universal interaction that people had grown used to from Facebook, Instagram, and elsewhere. [Xiaomi just can’t help brazenly ripping off Apple - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18232983/xiaomi-apple-macos-mojave-wallpaper-ripoff-mi9)
* In fact, it almost feels like the opposite of the iPhone: if you’ve been frustrated with Apple’s recent devices for lacking headphone jacks, adding notches, or removing fingerprint scanners, Samsung is here for you with a headphone jack, a fingerprint scanner, and a notchless screen design (that has some other compromises). It feels a bit like the S10 is the anti-iPhone.
