# Fascinating Technology Commentary (January 2019)

* Bandersnatch represents a new form of data mining that gives Netflix richer, more specific audience information than it’s ever had before. [Black Mirror: Bandersnatch could be Netflix’s secret marketing weapon - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing)
* Smartphones, the iPhone especially, have been on a constant growth trajectory for so long that we’ve come to expect them to keep perpetually expanding as a category. But, just as desktop PCs eventually reached a saturation point where almost every home that could afford a computer had a decent one, smartphone shipments had to eventually hit a level at which demand for them tapered off. [Apple and Samsung feel the sting of plateauing smartphones - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166399/iphone-android-apple-samsung-smartphone-sales-peak)
* I think gadgets are endlessly fascinating and the silly innovation at CES is extremely fun, so I love all of this. [Everything is too complicated: our annual list of confusing tech questions - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18170272/everything-is-too-complicated-2019)
* CES is great for seeing a little glimpse of the future, but real lives in the present are messy and complicated. Assuming that anyone cares about downloading one more app or creating one more secure password is a huge and potentially dangerous mistake. [Everything is too complicated: our annual list of confusing tech questions - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18170272/everything-is-too-complicated-2019)
* Why on earth is this still called iTunes? Are all these apps going to get rebranded when the TV service launches? Apple’s branding game has been real fuzzy lately. [Five big questions about Apple putting iTunes on Samsung TVs - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18170820/five-big-questions-about-apple-putting-itunes-on-samsung-tvs)
* Qualcomm arguably holds what FOSSPatents writer Florian Mueller has described as “mutually reinforcing monopolies” — one on wireless broadband modems, and another on certain patents. [Competitors say Qualcomm is running a monopoly — here’s why - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18173756/qualcomm-ftc-antitrust-monopoly-trial-explainer)
* CES is the land where platform wars confuse consumers and hold back progress in the industry — especially the TV industry. VHS versus Betamax. HD DVD versus Blu-ray. HDR10 versus Dolby Vision. Instead, a ton of companies all agreed to support a single standard created by a competitor, with neither preamble nor drama. [Apple’s TV industry embrace was an inevitable surprise - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18176992/apple-tv-airplay-homekit-itunes-samsung-lg-sony-android-tizen-ces-2019)
* It was Tim Cook in his former role as Apple’s chief operating officer that helped lead the global shift to foreign manufacturing some 15 years ago with the outsourcing of iPod assembly to Foxconn. [Why Apple can’t make computers in the USA - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18200330/why-apple-cant-made-in-america)
* It’s a common psychological phenomenon: repeat any word enough times, and it eventually loses all meaning, disintegrating like soggy tissue into phonetic nothingness. For many of us, the phrase “artificial intelligence” fell apart in this way a long time ago. AI is everywhere in tech right now, said to be powering everything from your TV to your toothbrush, but never have the words themselves meant less. [The state of AI in 2019 - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18197520/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-computational-science)
* Teaching computers to learn for themselves is a brilliant shortcut. And like all shortcuts, it involves cutting corners. There’s intelligence in AI systems, if you want to call it that. But it’s not organic intelligence, and it doesn’t play by the same rules humans do. You may as well ask: how clever is a book? What expertise is encoded in a frying pan?

* Amazon sure does love surprises. The original Echo came as a bolt out of the blue and even after the business was well established, the company just last September saw fit to unveil literally dozens of new Alexa products and features to an unsuspecting world. Last night’s announcement that Amazon intends to acquire the Eero mesh routing company was another surprise, but the out-of-nowhere nature of it shouldn’t have surprised anybody. That’s how Amazon does things. [Why Amazon buying Eero feels so disappointing - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18221441/amazon-buying-eero-disappointing)
* With the Apple Card, the company is going one step further and trying to capture not just what you consume, but also the financial means you use to do so. [The Apple Card is a perfect example of Apple’s post-iPhone strategy - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282946/apple-card-credit-post-iphone-strategy-services-business-digital-wallet-payments)
* In a former life, I was a TA at a university and taught a lot of freshman composition. Whenever a student turned in an essay that led with a dictionary definition of a word, I would audibly groan because I knew I was in for a slog. It is the classic sign of a paper that purports to be deeper and more insightful than it actually is. And it always led to a long edit where I had to put in a lot of effort to help the student clarify their ideas to say something genuinely original, something genuinely different from what has been said or done a thousand times before. Yet, Apple began its keynote with the definition of what a ‘service’ is. [Apple still has a lot to prove with its new subscription services - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282776/apple-tv-news-plus-subscription-services-announcement-keynote-cost-bundle)
* If you look at the project’s origins, it’s no surprise the service skews so heavily toward periodicals. Apple News Plus inherits the majority of its content from the app Texture, known as the “Netflix of magazines,” [Apple’s news subscription service doesn’t have a lot of news - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18281335/apple-news-plus-newsstand-needs-newspapers-magazines)
* Apple has created a monster. Free-to-play games have taken over the iOS App Store almost entirely, creating a marketplace that is dominated by scammy timers and cheap monetization schemes, one that no amount of quality game design, curation, and promotion have been able to fix. But now (after years of profiting off this system), Apple is here with the alleged cure: Apple Arcade. [Apple Arcade wants to slay the free-to-play monster iOS helped create - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284404/apple-arcade-free-to-play-games-paid-premium-subscription-comparison)
* This appreciation of great product design has led to it becoming a core tenet of the commercial success of any tech product in today’s marketplace. [Jony Ive made the entire tech world care about design - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/29/19203188/jony-ive-influence-tech-design)
